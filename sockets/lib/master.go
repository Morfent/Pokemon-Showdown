/**
 * Master - Master/Worker pattern implementation
 * https://pokemonshowdown.com/
 *
 * This makes it possible to parse messages from sockets and the parent process
 * concurrently. A command queue stores commands created by the multiplexer and
 * IPC connection. The master contains a pool of command channels belonging to
 * workers. Once a command is available in the queue, the master takes a
 * worker's command channel from its pool and enqueues it. The worker takes the
 * command and processes it before enqueueing its command channel back into the
 * master's pool. The workers are distributed round-robin, much like Node's
 * cluster module (when not using Windows).
